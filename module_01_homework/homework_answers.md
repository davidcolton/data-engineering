5. Over 10 miles 

Answers:

- 104,802;  197,670;  110,612;  27,831;  35,281
- 104,802;  198,924;  109,603;  27,678;  35,189

- 104,838;  199,013;  109,645;  27,688;  35,202

## Answer 3.

`104,802;  198,924;  109,603;  27,678;  35,189`

``` sql
select count(*) as "Less than 1 mile"
from   green_taxi_data 
where  DATE(lpep_pickup_datetime) >= '2019-10-01'
and    DATE(lpep_dropoff_datetime) < '2019-11-01'
and    trip_distance <= 1;

select count(*) as "Between 1 and 3 miles"
from   green_taxi_data
where  DATE(lpep_pickup_datetime) >= '2019-10-01'
and    DATE(lpep_dropoff_datetime) < '2019-11-01'
and    trip_distance > 1
and    trip_distance <= 3;

select count(*) as "Between 3 and 7 miles"
from   green_taxi_data
where  DATE(lpep_pickup_datetime) >= '2019-10-01'
and    DATE(lpep_dropoff_datetime) < '2019-11-01'
and    trip_distance > 3
and    trip_distance <= 7;

select count(*) as "Between 7 and 10 miles"
from   green_taxi_data
where  DATE(lpep_pickup_datetime) >= '2019-10-01'
and    DATE(lpep_dropoff_datetime) < '2019-11-01'
and    trip_distance > 7
and    trip_distance <= 10;

select count(*) as "Less than 10 miles"
from   green_taxi_data
where  DATE(lpep_pickup_datetime) >= '2019-10-01'
and    DATE(lpep_dropoff_datetime) < '2019-11-01'
and    trip_distance > 10;
```

## Question 4. Longest trip for each day

Which was the pick up day with the longest trip distance?
Use the pick up time for your calculations.

Tip: For every day, we only care about one single trip with the longest distance. 

- 2019-10-11
- 2019-10-24
- 2019-10-26
- 2019-10-31

## Answer 4.

Pickup Day:`"2019-10-31 23:23:41"`

Trip Distance: `515.89` miles

```sql
select   lpep_pickup_datetime, trip_distance
from     green_taxi_data
where    trip_distance = ( 
  select max(trip_distance)
  from   green_taxi_data
);
```

## Question 5. Three biggest pickup zones

Which were the top pickup locations with over 13,000 in
`total_amount` (across all trips) for 2019-10-18?

Consider only `lpep_pickup_datetime` when filtering by date.

- East Harlem North, East Harlem South, Morningside Heights
- East Harlem North, Morningside Heights
- Morningside Heights, Astoria Park, East Harlem South
- Bedford, East Harlem North, Astoria Park

## Answer 5.

```
"East Harlem North"
"East Harlem South"
"Morningside Heights"
```

```sql
select "Zone"
from   public.zone_data
where  "LocationID" in (
	select   "PULocationID"
	from     green_taxi_data
	where    DATE(lpep_pickup_datetime) = '2019-10-18'
	group by "PULocationID"
	having   sum(total_amount) > 13000
	order by 1 desc
	limit    3
)
```

## Question 6. Largest tip

For the passengers picked up in October 2019 in the zone
name "East Harlem North" which was the drop off zone that had
the largest tip?

Note: it's `tip` , not `trip`

We need the name of the zone, not the ID.

- Yorkville West
- JFK Airport
- East Harlem North
- East Harlem South

## Answer 6.

Drop Off Zone: `"JFK Airport"`

Tip Amount: `87.3`

```sql
select zdd."Zone",
    tip_amount
from public.green_taxi_data as gtd
    join public.zone_data as zdp on gtd."PULocationID" = zdp."LocationID"
    join public.zone_data as zdd on gtd."DOLocationID" = zdd."LocationID"
where DATE(lpep_pickup_datetime) >= '2019-10-01'
    and DATE(lpep_pickup_datetime) <= '2019-10-31'
    and zdp."Zone" = 'East Harlem North'
order by 2 desc
limit 1;
```
